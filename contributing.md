## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- If you are adding a new section include a description of what belongs under that heading and an entry to the Contents.
- If you are writing an entry about something that is not yours, avoid judgemental language. However, any text in the item's self-description can be included.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Add new items to the right spot in the list -- items within each section should be listed alphabetically.
- Comment on why something is awesome. Links are great, but give someone a reason to follow the link.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Check your spelling and grammar. Start each item with an uppercase character and end it with a period.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Do not include new lines within a bullet point or paragraph. Set your editor to line wrap.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
