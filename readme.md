A list of lists of awesome [IIIF](http://iiif.io/) resources.

The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is a group of standard APIs around sharing and reuse of media. It is also a growing community of galleries, libraries, archives, museums, companies, and others who develop the standards and interoperable software implementations. Content includes helpful links around each of the standards, demonstrations of their use, and tutorials and presentations. The list is especially helpful for orienting new community members and developers.

## Standards

The IIIF community has developed several standards for interoperable web-based image delivery.

- [Image API](http://iiif.io/api/image/) - specifies a web service that returns an image in response to a standard HTTP or HTTPS request.
- [Presentation API](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/) - provides the information necessary to allow a rich, online viewing environment for primarily image-based objects to be presented to a human user, likely in conjunction with the IIIF Image API.
- [Content Search API](http://iiif.io/api/search/) - specifies interoperability mechanism for searching within annotations.
- [Authentication API](http://iiif.io/api/auth/) - describes a set of workflows for guiding the user through an existing access control system.
- [External Services API Annex](http://iiif.io/api/annex/services/) - describes the set of related services that have been identified as useful to reference from the IIIF APIs.
- [API Annex Documents](http://iiif.io/api/annex/) - List of all API annex documents and API implementation notes.
